## While You Explore My Page🦋🌎
- You'll be greeted with an image slider that allows you to change the photos alongside having a subheading 
- Directly below you will notice my navigation bar that stays at the top of the page as you explore the rest of my site
- Immediately below the nav bar is my about me section, that provides a photo of the creator and a small blurb.
- After viewing the About Me section, you will notice my analysis of my current technical skills by category.
- By now, you have reached my Stats section and this just provides some insight on how much I have accomplished since starting bootcamp
- Second to Last is my Contact Section where I provide different ways to connect with me(LinkedIn, Twitter, Github, & Email)
-Lastly is my portfolio section, and I just used some images as placeholders while I perpare to place polished projects in place of those images.
